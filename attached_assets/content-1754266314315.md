## Questions & answers

Everything you need to know about Heidi.

[Speak to Heidi team](https://www.heidihealth.com/contact-sales)

Is Heidi worth it?

If you’re looking to save time on documentation and streamline your clinical workflows, Heidi could be a great investment. [Customers around the world](https://www.heidihealth.com/customers) report increased satisfaction, reduced stress, and better work-life balance after adopting Heidi. We're a team of clinicians genuinely trying to change clinicians' lives. With a strong commitment to [data security and patient safety](https://www.heidihealth.com/safety), Heidi helps ensure you can stay aligned with industry standards. Currently supporting over 1.5 million consultations every week, Heidi quietly works in the background so you can focus more on patients and less on paperwork. Whether you're part of a solo practice or a large healthcare system, Heidi is here to free up your time, have more billable hours, and supercharge your patient care.

Can I cancel my Heidi subscription at any time?

Yes, you can cancel your Heidi subscription at any time. If you decide to cancel, you will retain access to the features of your current plan until the end of the current billing cycle. If you're on an annual plan, you won't be charged for the following year after cancellation. For further assistance or any details regarding cancellations, feel free to [reach out to our support team](https://www.heidihealth.com/contact).

Can I switch between Heidi pricing plans?

Yes, you can switch between Heidi pricing plans through your account settings. If you're upgrading from Free to Pro, just log in to your Heidi account, navigate to the Account section, and click the purple “Upgrade” button to complete the process. To switch from Pro Monthly to Pro Annual, you can do it directly in your account settings. [To move from the Together plan to Pro Annual](https://www.heidihealth.com/support/en/articles/10997994-changing-your-heidi-subscription), simply go to the Billing Portal in your account settings, click "Update subscription," select the Pro plan, and confirm the update. Note that downgrading from Together to Pro will result in the loss of access to integrations and team templates.

How do I know if Heidi Enterprise is right for me?

If you are part of a large organization that requires customized solutions beyond the features offered in the Together plan, Heidi Enterprise is the right option for you. Enterprise is ideal for teams needing custom system integration, multi-team management, coding workflows, and single sign-on (SSO) with user directories. This plan is designed to support complex organizational structures and can be personalized to fit your specific needs. If you're unsure, [contact our sales team](https://www.heidihealth.com/contact-sales) to discuss how Heidi Enterprise can be tailored for your organization.

When should I upgrade to the Together plan?

Consider the Together plan if your team requires collaboration tools to work seamlessly with each other. This plan is ideal for teams that need to [share templates](https://www.heidihealth.com/support/en/articles/9587992-managing-templates-in-your-team), have multiple users accessing content, or require session sharing features, such as [enabling an admin](https://www.heidihealth.com/support/en/articles/10382257-user-roles) to produce secondary documents from a doctor’s notes. It also benefits solo practitioners using integration partners for their patient records such as [MedicalDirector](https://www.heidihealth.com/blog/medicaldirector-integration), [Athenahealth](https://www.heidihealth.com/blog/athenahealth-integration), [Semble](https://www.heidihealth.com/blog/semble-integration), [Halaxy](https://www.heidihealth.com/blog/halaxy-integration), and more. With team multi-factor authentication (MFA), template creation services, and priority customer support, the Together plan is designed to streamline workflows and enhance collaboration for both teams and individual users with advanced needs.

What is the main difference between Free and Heidi Pro?

The main difference between the Free and Heidi Pro plans is the level of customization and additional features. The Free plan provides unlimited note generation using basic templates with only 10 [Pro Actions](https://www.heidihealth.com/support/en/articles/8885030-heidi-s-pricing-plans-cost-features) per month, while the Heidi Pro plan offers unlimited custom templates, unlimited Pro Actions, and unlimited access to Ask Heidi AI for advanced document generation and personalization. Additionally, Pro users can [set up a team](https://www.heidihealth.com/support/en/articles/9560724-heidi-teams) solely for accounting purposes, to get all the billing into one place.

Why is there a free version of Heidi forever?

Heidi offers a free plan to ensure accessibility and engagement for all healthcare professionals. By allowing users to experience the free product, Heidi provides enough time for clinicians to see its value and consider upgrading for more personalized features. This approach not only supports health equity by making AI tools available to more users worldwide, but also helps us gather valuable feedback to keep improving. Ultimately, the free plan aims to save time for clinicians while promoting broader adoption. /
