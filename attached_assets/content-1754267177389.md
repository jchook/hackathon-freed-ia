[**Like many others have report**](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/688fcc022a71960f3583c739)

Like many others have report, Heidi was great up until a month ago. Most recently it recorded my dialogue as the client not the clinician. I don't think I can use it anymore as it is now more problematic to edit the case notes than to write them correctly. I am trying Novonotes but I'm not convinced Novo is any better.

Really disappointing, Heidi "was" so amazing, maybe to good to be be true. I hope you get it back to what "they" were.

Also, working on a pay as you go structure would be great. I have been using the free service and when Heidi was working really well, I would have paid for it but I only operate my private clinic once a week so a monthly subscription is not worth it and I would not pay for it at the moment anyway, its not worth it.

I do hope you get back to where it was though.

[**Useless Heidi Health AI app**](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/688e2dd0779ed182bcc0fb99)

I reviewed Heidi Health AI on 12 July, highlighting some of the issues with the app and browser system. The issues I have encountered are very similar to those of many other people out tehre.

Today, 2 August 2025, all remains the same with the app. The browser is a bit faster now, but the Windows app is useless.

The big problem is that I cannot use the browser for online work, as they change the settings and they say we can only use the app for online work, while the app is not good for face-to-face work. Ridiculous system. Makes no sense, should all be integrated.

Issues with app:

1 - takes ages to refresh a transcript, sometimes up to 5 minutes, which is too long for when I have sessions back to back.

2 - logs off automatically if "transcribing" for more than 30 minutes and cannot tolerate an hour at all.

3 - I have to close the app, open it again and it asks me to log in. Clearly Heidi is not listening to feedback, because the app should remember the computer like the browser does, and there should be no need to log in each time.

4 - The app incorrectly states that we can start a new session while the other session generates a transcript, but that is not true. The app was taking so long that I could not wait any longer so i followed the instructions. When the 2nd session ended, it had not done any transcribing at all, as it clearly cannot run 2 processes at once, like teh browser can.

5 - The app is a pointless system. All I need is for the browser to be able to transcribe remote video sessions properly, like it does Face-to-face, and then I can delete the app. The app has caused me so much stress and I absolutely hate it. Why create a silly app when the browser was doing such a good job before?

Please fix the browser to be able to do everything, and close the app down.

[**New User to Heidi**](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/68871829d545283d3335b326)

Beguiled by Heidi only very recently after colleague here recommended "them" enthusiastically. I did try Freed in early 2024 and gave up after a month, due in large part to a lack of support for templates.

TL;DR: "Ambient Listening" is probably going to remain "hit and miss". I am afraid if a specialist is hoping that Heidi will remain consistently amazing in this workflow, even with patients frequently contradicting themselves - I have been a patient myself and at multiple times I caught myself contradicting me - thanks to "rogue" crests of brain wave sweeping over my over-the-hill noggin at any given time ... that practitioner is going to be disappointed.

Anyhow, IMO it would be unrealistic to expect Heidi to be superior to a junior resident in being able to distill information in a way that is congruent with a physician's AGENDA and do so with minimal supervision.

For GPs who are recording a myriad of primary care issues, making a general set recommendations, +/- referrals, Heidi may do okay. I can only speculate and don't really know first hand.

But a fast-typing 3rd year med student could possibly scribe okay in above scenarios as well. Some of the differences may come down to "agenda". It is a given that GPs and so-called specialists have different agendas.

I say above from personal experience, as I employed human scribes on and off prior to the pandemic. Two of my then scribes are now practicing physicians. Some things were surely difficult for them at the time.

My 2 cents is that "Ambient Listening" will remain iffy with the current fundamentals. Lining up another billion GPUs and burning up another terawatts of hydro probably will still not give us a "senior clerk".

However, where Heidi shines is in its transcription capability. I don't mean "word for word" dictation, which I never use.

I use its "transcription" simply as "dictation with template" and it works very well. I generally shun "ambient listening".

Its "free text" transcription basically leaves DMPE / DMO in the dust. And if in the middle of a dictation, something came to me that I forgot in Past History, I'd simply tell Heidi to add the bits to that section, which Heidi does generally without failing.

Basically Heidi the LLM isn't going to replace Heidi the junior resident. But Heidi the LLM has replaced Heidi the traditional transcriptionist.

Now wait a minute! Hadn't Dragon / DMO replaced transcriptionists en masse over a decade ago? Well in liquidating latters' jobs perhaps.

But as a proper replacement Dragon hardly did. With Dragon one's eye balls do have to be glued to the screen, generally.

But with Heidi, one can keep "eyes shut", and just "dictate away", while "jumping around" the template freely - just like with a human transcriptionist of old.

Now, I echo the complaint that Heidi's Assessment is bonkers 9 times out of 10, and that's despite I tell Heidi unequivocally in my prompts not to put anything under Assessment unless I explicitly say so.

Anyway, I just edit it out with DMO. In that regard Dragon still has a role for me.

BTW, do folks realize that DMO has 98% "Select-and-Say" capability in desktop Heidi session under Chrome? This makes it easy to fine-tune output with Dragon.

But one does have to get used to swapping input between DMO and Heidi.

Anyhow, Heidi's new-fangled "verbal trigger" for snippets is useful - reprising, I'd say, 80% of DMO's AutoText functionality.

Caveat, this is done through "Replacement" in Memory. Their advertised "verbal trigger" is only available in "word for word dictation" mode, and not in the "transcription mode" that I use.

FWIW, I use the "word for word dictation style" under the "transcription mode" and never the "word for word dictation mode".

Above is a vivid example on how Heidi's nomenclature and settings layout are "chaotic" (being charitable here).

I also prefer Detailed to "Goldilocks".

In fairness, I could see Heidi making an effort in responding to complaints timely. I recently asked them to add in the Canadian short date format "xxxx-xx-xx", as opposed to only "xxxx/xx/xx", and they seem to have escalated it.

It may just be a nuisance, as this kind of input masking can be tweaked with RegEx easily. As a long-term AutoHotkey user, I do carry out post-processing in Clipboard as "bread and butter" ...

But reading the "wrong" format in notes bugs me to no end!

Many have surely complained about Heidi not being able to execute a simple "new paragraph", as Dragon could from ... 1995? Very recently I see that Heidi has tried to address this through "Snippets".

As per my testing, it still doesn't work well, for the LLM behind Heidi still could not recognize "new paragraph" as a phrase consistently!

FWIW, a monkey workaround has mostly solved the "new paragraph" conundrum for me.

Well, hit 4000 characters!

[**Customer Complaints Ignored for 4+ months**](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6886a4242fd357bdb8c97229)

Notice how all reviews since March have been quite negative? Below is a prime example; I noticed that the program was including details in my templates that were NOT stated by patients; it is filling in details which is entirely inappropriate! When I asked the AI in the question bar why it did so, it gave this response: "The assessment and plan section of the document incorporates clinical reasoning and interpretations based on the information gathered during the encounter, rather than just transcribing the conversation." The program continues to do whatever it wants at random; this is NOT what users want. If Heidi as a company wants to continue operating it HAS to stop the program from going rogue and making unilateral decisions. What is so hard for you people to understand? And also the complete lack of timely support, AI-generated replies, etc just shows how wholly uninterested the company is in its customers. Either fix these issues or be left in bankruptcy in 2 years, your choice Heidi.

[**When it works, it's good but.....**](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/68808dbc9d065f7830f4e0bd)

When it works, it works well but when it doesn't, it causes excessive catch up work.

Generally the notes that it transcribes as per my templates are good. All need to be edited which is to be expected. What is an ongoing issue is that several sessions don't generate the transcript per week, leaving me to fill in the gaps. It also takes a long time to generate a note so I have to stand around waiting for it sometimes for several minutes when I'd prefer to just get started with the next client/patient Overall the poor generation record is problematic. The lack of real person/real time support is hard to swallow given the cost. Halaxy has a much better support system

[**Recent update has made it much worse**](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/68765201b5b0f64b7f6faf71)

Recent update has made it much worse - Heidi won't offer refunds despite service becoming unusable.

Heidi used to pick up most of the important details from the case history, and advice and exercises given. I had to spend a lot of time correcting inaccuracies, but despite this it was still useful. Now it seems to miss almost all of the important detail. Despite the level of service becoming unusable (and definitely not what I signed up for), Heidi won't offer a refund.

Lesson learned - avoid the paid version, and definitely don't commit to a year up front.

I initially found Heidihealth helpful, but unfortunately my experience declined over time. I was automatically locked into a paid subscription, and cancelling before payments began required multiple back-and-forth emails, which was frustrating. The transcription feature also stopped working without warning, and resolving this issue now feels like a complicated process. Overall, I’ve found these aspects difficult to navigate and not particularly user friendly.

Heidi worked great until few weeks ago. Only started using 2 months back. The notes were great and had a lot of details which I prefer as a GP. Then last month, something changed. Since then, the notes have been all over the place, very short, barely covering any details. I have stopped using it for consultations, so have a couple of my other colleagues, who said the same thing - poor notes, no details, having to edit a lot, which makes it time consuming rather than easy. I use dictation function when needed but not transcribing anymore. Nevertheless, it was helpful and great when it started. Was very happy with it. Might try it now and again to see if note taking improved. If not, am back to manual typing until I find something better to work with..

There must have been a recent update to the system. Templates that I have used consistently and not changed in quite some time are now soooo much less helpful. The program is including it's own inferences/recommendations into HPI and Assessment/Plan sections (making recommendations for management that I NEVER STATED), excluding information that I explicitly stated, and the formatting of the HPI is totally different. When I ask it to remove the changes, it just regenerates an even less useful note and does not acknowledge my requests. Such a waste of time for me in the last few weeks. They need to reverse whatever changes they made and leave things alone.

[**Failure to transcribe**](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67dca97005a58179c5b8adbf)

While uncommon, sometimes Heidi stuffs up and no transcript is made of a consultation. This is unacceptable, as the whole consultation needs to be typed from memory after the fact.

Support have been useless, as they seem to only use AI chatbots.

Hello Mark.

Thank you for your feedback, and we're truly sorry you've had this experience. We completely understand how frustrating and unacceptable it is when a transcript fails to generate, especially when it leaves you having to reconstruct the consultation from memory. That’s not the experience we want for any clinician using Heidi.

While issues like this are rare, they are taken very seriously. We’ve recently been investing heavily in both the reliability of transcript generation and our support services. This includes expanding our human support team so you're not left relying solely on automated responses. Our team would really appreciate the opportunity to investigate this further and work with you to resolve the issue.

Once again, thank you for sharing your feedback.

[**Creams / medications incorrectly spelled**](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67c6e28ba89fac68538dea60)

I have to say, I don’t find Heidi very helpful for my consultations. It is the most accurate I have tried, however it still often gets the names of creams/ medications wrong and it can’t seem to cope with the complexity of my consultations. I suspect it is fine for GPs or certain specialties, but it doesn’t seem to work well for me unfortunately.

Good communication experience and customer service after a significant billing error was made. I was grateful for the people that tried to help, they were real people and they followed up with me today.
