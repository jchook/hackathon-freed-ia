## Automated clinical tasks list

Tasks enables Heidi to **automatically identify and organize action items** from your clinical notes. Think, no more sticky notes, no more mental checklists, no more wondering, “Why is ‘Order CT scan for Mrs. Smith’ written in my calendar?”

With Tasks, **everything you need to follow up** on is neatly color-coded in an **interactive list** next to your note.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/68411886b1d18cc59fa01de9_AD_4nXfoKpHeAufSqrQimZUkrOHZ6fIvDMeVp_elCds3ZhtL22cP7EQulvUqzHxT-tIAQ7BlYhZk0acxlPRiit2qGPJ_U88aYZiJwjGw9lG-7uWBco_zqtuu93erLalkVrhieGvCPiSfcw.png)

In the tasks panel, you can:

- Edit the description or Task type.
- Add new Tasks with the + icon at the bottom of the list.
- Cross items off the list after completion.
- Clarify the clinical rationale through highlighted evidence in the transcript.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/6841188550ad103f492380d9_AD_4nXdhSmuusjOp8TCf87eTkv_IPhDVgN7oJ5fIOKQ_G0aDkczjGZL6HISbdqcc9Ga33b6JDzNScPjZPyHH4kX84h2fkBv46O2nV6J73dlnM9tcdGOnBYCBdY7jC62KiJ_3J496YpmjXA.png)

Tap on any suggested task to instantly view the exact point in the note or transcript where it was captured—so you can quickly confirm key details without scanning the full note.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/684118869fe0483f28afd4cf_AD_4nXfwv1OH0JEG7KciQgGT6MBJQS1WSddvJDUCEVJNK5V9E_ndQ3-SoQyu4pbWG17nsyUoyxnaJ4hnqwSZja_tIWZRsloa7ahsGsGCuhWMCAG-uDEQS7K2-o6zs0TjEvQb2G4umuMr.png)

In the Tasks menu, you’ll find your full Master Task List—showing all outstanding action items across patients and sessions. The list is fully searchable, making it easy to track and manage follow-ups in one place.

To keep things clear and focused, tasks marked ‘To do’ that remain inactive for 30 days are automatically archived. You can restore any archived task at any time, so nothing is ever lost permanently.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/684118855cb88a220247d1e8_AD_4nXeqardTLK1tSYp-1wAWxCVBL28tlT_9SSrAYZgeyL4idUTFf1BNAmgcnYH6S7QsJg7eO-7ZljeoA-WRHZAkPr5aerY0yqauwi6TXUjImu-zgx3hsSRZ8BEf27U82ExCI3Kig1VW.png)

Heidi’s Tasks help to:

- Minimize the cognitive load of identifying, organizing, and tracking action items from clinical encounters.
- Reduce the risk of inadvertently overlooking (or deprioritizing) an urgent clinical task.
- Support the seamless handover of action items to clinical assistants and colleagues.
- Justify billing by attaching evidence to treatment and management decisions.

**_Tasks is currently in a phased beta rollout. Get early access via Heidi Labs in Preferences._**

## Add previous sessions to Context

Conducting follow-up appointments with Heidi just got easier. You can now **add past sessions to Context** with the click of a button.

To use linked patient sessions as Context, navigate to the Context tab and open the Past sessions menu (in the bottom left).

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/68411885c0169bb5bdf94dd7_AD_4nXekSzHCIijCk2Hh4OsjSelZ27hS5r3x797W1r8Fjgf5hvE2Gvkanug5KDBJyTBGtH0b-9WcGLBr_zuJqw9POTIPvuLhL_kYxTlkQpkhOh-aY6i0xZq0SAiYxaRIe9s1vqT2OYJRww.png)

Select up to three linked sessions for immediate use as Context for in current notes and documents (no more copy & pasting entire sessions into Context!).

_\*instructions for creating patient profiles and session linking is_ [_available here_](https://www.heidihealth.com/support/en/articles/10122397-patient-profiles-and-session-linking-in-heidi).

Benefits of using **linked session as Context** include:

- **Choose any sequence of sessions -** Include sessions based on recency, significance (e.g., a detail-rich initial assessment), or a combination of both.
- **Avoids verbally recapping history -** No need to verbally “prime” Heidi with a summary of recent events in the session, making follow-up appointments more efficient.
- **Clarify information with Ask Heidi -** Heidi can instantly confirm details from linked contextual sessions, like a medication list, discharge date, or treatment plan.
- **Inclusion of history in templates -** The template prompt (previous notes)instructs Heidi to automatically reference previous sessions in outputs.

See the Help Centre article on [Linked Previous Sessions](https://www.heidihealth.com/support/en/articles/11362092-linked-previous-sessions) for more details.

## Voice-Activated Snippets

As Heidi evolves into a more hands-free experience, clinicians now have the option of utilizing voice-activatedSnippets (Heidi’s version of word macros).

To activate this feature, create a **verbal trigger for your Snippet** in the Memory menu.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/68411885e6d5ffcc315ef902_AD_4nXdSjWA7u58Xf9-w-TyVAJVvs2XWzsI3tWJN5gye2ShktZmoJvmFyNsHC8uBZ6lIckoVFcjXP8W5hsKcK28VE-CbuEsFDai8rU57s2cP1Tf1MeBpBLYNIjx0OAIMl-GfAp5CN9uAig.png)

Then, with a completed document or note open (or in Context):

1. Activate [cursor-guided dictation](https://www.heidihealth.com/changelog/cursor-guided-dictation-and-better-voice-control) with the microphone icon
2. Select where you want the Snippet to appear
3. Say the verbal trigger

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/684118852fe43452c514fa03_AD_4nXcd03Vx1cx8IOt2xUh20nC0RQ29dYDamO7DXmSOnmsah77uVtsGUkd7DYkxq5fNTG5OXKC__wszYUmH_4yaGXMYJ3sHaOaS-LeRKa-TdcsSEXXwjiEIJ47dzIAaImaW8fLz5dZt.png)

## Dictate into Ask Heidi

Ask Heidi is that unassuming little box at the bottom of the session window that allows you to get Heidi’s help with anything.

Your imagination really is the limit with Ask Heidi. You can ask her to create a summary of your session, change the formatting of a note, or even retrieve information from [files uploaded to Context](https://www.heidihealth.com/changelog/context-upgrades-and-snomed-coding).

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/6841188507b580cb12f26d62_AD_4nXfs6gJysfKLzXDhgDS7AneP-U99O67B7HWXVp0np7Lt-nAILNjylEb39TvhwitAb-PMd-g6dWpvl37dH3phgwV4sBuxJ7WX_gQlbvqOxqjzB1Rr_1MVPB4ZW6mdEBUJxrYCBrUmcA.png)

Queries previously had to be typed into Ask Heidi. But with dictation becoming available everywhere, you can also ask questions by voice (via the microphone icon to the right of the box). Great for longer questions or performing multi-step iterative tasks.

## AI document suggestions

Next time you hit **Create** to generate an output, check out the suggestions under the **Generate a document with AI** heading.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/684118859deb67cbb2a510ab_AD_4nXdmkbHB5XVXkQ1h8IpXWai1UVvlSccb7V4DCtJsrsfKX4QvwrgDSJ9F2vRu34dxJGix8E4tQIA2eiXqijxY7T8i3GenvM25UiX2JiKp4leHy8U2zdmJJYFKdRYMhZATMIDv8O1Rzg.png)

You’ll find three suggested actions based on Heidi's analysis of the encounter. If any aligns with your intended actions (or perhaps something you hadn’t thought of yet), select it and the output automatically generates.

All part of our mission to reduce the cognitive load involved in documentation, giving you more bandwidth for the important things.

## Dictation at your cursor

The previously sharp distinction between transcription and dictation is gone. Clinicians can now **dictate everywhere** in notes, documents, and Context.

If you prefer to make edits or additions by voice rather than typing, simply click the microphone icon near the copy button and move the cursor to where you want to begin dictating.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/681978514064e207192168b8_Dictation%20%E2%80%93%20Hover%20over%20mic%20icon.png)

Dictated text appears as it’s spoken. **Voice commands** can be used for formatting and punctuation (new line, comma, new paragraph, etc).

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/681979a6f12a1ed8906230a0_Dictation%20%E2%80%93%20In%20progress.png)

By toggling the dictation button, you can flip between manual typing and cursor-guided dictation, until your text is precisely to your preference.

Users can still choose between dictation or transcription upon beginning a new session. However, these functions will be merged in the near future, providing a more cohesive user experience (and a definitive end to the need for separate scribing and dictation products).

## More granular voice control

Making Heidi sound exactly like you just got easier, with more granular control over Voice in the new **Customise style** menu.

To access the menu, click on the voice icon during a session.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/68197982eff349ff90f0abb4_New%20scribe%20controls.png)

Here’s what’s changed:

- **Brain is now Scribe -** Standard scribe (previously Left Brain) produces optimum results for the vast majority of sessions. Some clinicians who conduct longer, more complex sessions may prefer Extended scribe (previously Right Brain).
- **Custom Level of detail -** Standard Voice styles can be further customized with the Level of detail slider. **‍**
- **Additional stylistic preferences -** Toggle the use of bullet points, patient quotes, and abbreviations on and off.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/68197a46a79d28db210b8a85_New%20scribe%20controls%20%E2%80%93%20customised.png)

**Please note:** Template instructions are always prioritized over Voice settings. For example, if your template instructs Heidi to never use abbreviations, toggling on ‘Include abbreviations’ _will not_ result in abbreviations being used in the output.

You can set default choices for all of the above in the Preferences menu via the sidebar.

## Session summary in the header

A short summary with details from the session now auto-populates in the header.

Clicking on the session summary opens an editing window where details can be changed.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/681979c215f20028f4e83cf3_Session%20summary%20%E2%80%93%20in%20header.png)

The summary is the title displayed in the Sessions list until patient details are added (or the session is linked with a patient profile).

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/681979e6cb8e43c1d731a8aa_Session%20summary%20%E2%80%93%20in%20session%20list.png)

**Benefits of the new session summary** include:

- Easier scanning of linked sessions that sit within a patient’s profile

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/68197892562e66bb31aabe51_Session%20summary%20%E2%80%93%20for%20linked%20sessions.png)

- Patient details and session summary can be separated, supporting a wider range of naming conventions
- All encounters in the Sessions list have a title, making it easier to identify individual sessions
- The risk of inadvertently opening and working on the wrong encounter is minimized

[**ICD-10 coding and more intelligent Context**](https://www.heidihealth.com/changelog/icd-10-coding-and-more-intelligent-context)

[this link is used for the script](https://www.heidihealth.com/changelog/icd-10-coding-and-more-intelligent-context)

## ICD-10 coding

Following the recent release of [SNOMED coding in Heidi](https://www.heidihealth.com/changelog/context-upgrades-and-snomed-coding), a phased rollout of ICD-10 coding is underway.

Participating users can enable **ICD-10-CM** coding via Memory. This is suitable for US-based clinicians.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/6808242fa28c84d56adffac3_Memory%20-%20ICD-10-CM.png)

Once enabled, Heidi presents a list of suggested ICD-10 codes after processing each clinical encounter.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/68082417e5c44e43ed4df9dd_SNOMED%20codes%20-%20view%20code.png)

Upon viewing the list of suggested codes, clinicians can:

- **Confirm** an individual code by checking a box
- View **Code specification** by selecting the info icon
- **Review evidence** from the transcript supporting each code (waveform icon)
- **Replace** a code by searching for a suitable alternative
- **Remove** individual codes from the list

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/6808244789c597f9465ac8db_SNOMED%20codes%20-%20view%20evidence.png)

ICD-10-CM codes will display a **billable badge** to qualifying codes - this can be toggled on or off.

New codes can be added from the sidebar, with code set **filter options** for clinicians utilizing both SNOMED and ICD-10 codes

**Please note:** Clinicians are responsible for manually reviewing all suggested codes to ensure they accurately reflect the patient encounter.

ICD-10 coding is currently in limited beta release. If you do not already have access and would like to enroll, please reach out to us.

Detailed [instructions on coding](https://www.heidihealth.com/support/en/articles/10383059-coding) are available in the Help Centre.

## Enhanced handwriting and PDF recognition

Since adding the ability to [attach files to Context](https://www.heidihealth.com/changelog/context-upgrades-and-snomed-coding), Heidi has processed tens of thousands of PDFs, .doc files, and images.

While our testing shows a >99% success rate, we’re aware of occasional instances where Heidi struggles to interpret an image of handwritten notes or a complex PDF (such as a PDF with redacted text or a combination of images and text).

We’ve gone back to the drawing board - Heidi can now parse handwriting and complex PDFs, accurately extracting data from even the messiest of uploads.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/680825015d385a854f8d297e_Ask%20Heidi%20-%20with%20files.png)

## Snippets in Context

Clinicians who regularly utilize Snippets in notes and documents will be pleased to know this feature is now enabled in Context.

Simply enter the shorthand cue/trigger for your Snippet in the Context tab and your pre-saved block of text appears.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/680824b0c397e039c00a5b91_Context%20-%20snippets.png)

Snippets in Context is great for situations where it’s faster to manually enter information compared to attaching a document, such as:

- Acknowledging a test or investigation where no abnormalities were detected
- Quickly adding background information that you’ve committed to memory
- Giving Heidi context about the scope of practice or visit type
- Including common referral centre information

The Heidi Widget and Chrome Extension provide a connected experience for clinicians whose EHRs are not formally integrated with Heidi.

Initially, the Widget and Chrome Extension focused on replicating the Heidi browser experience’s core transcribing and document generation features. However, recent enhancements bring these tools closer to feature parity, delivering more of the [full Heidi experience everywhere](https://www.heidihealth.com/au/download).

## Widget does more

The Heidi Widget is a nimble integration designed for web-based EHRs. It allows providers to quickly access Heidi’s core capabilities with minimal engineering effort.

We’ve expanded functionality of the Widget by adding the following features:

- Ask Heidi
- Brain settings (choose between Left or Right)
- Regenerate a note or document
- Pause sessions
- See session duration
- Modify language
- Consent modal (can be toggled on or off)

![Heidi widget does more](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67f5bb181476d41723269e0f_Chrome%20extension.png)

## Chrome Extension improvements

Floating next to any browser-based EHR, Heidi’s Chrome Extension lets you copy or push information directly into the patient’s medical record, without changing tabs or windows.

[Last month](https://www.heidihealth.com/au/changelog/new-assistant-role), we sneakily added Ask Heidi, a pause button, Brain settings, and note regeneration to the Chrome Extension.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67f5bb53e0e5e54c2854b5b3_Teams%20-%20roles.png)

This month, Jane, Elation, and Input Health join the list of tested EHRs (the Chrome Extension is compatible with all browser-based EHRs).

We also heard that magic paste in the Chrome Extension can occasionally be temperamental. So we added a new contextual menu as an alternative/backup option for clinicians using supported EHRs.

To access the contextual menu, right click the intended text field target and scroll down to see the magic paste options.

![Ask Heidi AI](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67f5c1ed37069d9026800b31_Chrome%20extension%20-%20ask%20Heidi.png)

## Default email setting

Heidi’s **Send as email** function lets you instantly send a copy of a note or document to a patient, assistant, or colleague.

![Heidi default email setting](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67f5bb93730f66cb8b9b14e9_Default%20email%20setting.png)

Clinicians use this feature for things like:

- Providing an explainer or summary to a patient or caregiver
- Forwarding letters, referrals, or reports to a secretary for processing
- Emailing a treatment summary or handover to a colleague
- Generating a summary of care and sending it directly to an insurer

Previously, emailing from Heidi required the clinician to manually enter their email address before sending. Now, in our quest to eliminate all unnecessary clicks and keystrokes, you can set a default pre-populated address.

**Please note:** Your default email address can be changed at any time in Preferences > Defaults > Default export email.

[**New Assistant role**](https://www.heidihealth.com/changelog/new-assistant-role)

[this link is used for the script](https://www.heidihealth.com/changelog/new-assistant-role)

![Copied Image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/651be5e5347ad738119bc256/6687b7aa334ea63f23b909e6_Tooltip%20(1).svg)

A new Assistant role builds on our recent [improvements for teams](https://www.heidihealth.com/changelog/better-team-management-and-new-default-templates).

![Heidi health AI screenshot](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67de0cc3cc4eebc34a33a9e5_Teams%20-%20admin%20permissions.png)

Patient care is a team game. Invite your support staff to your sessions without affecting your team’s bill, with a new **Assistant** role.

Assistants on Heidi can:

- **Create and prepare sessions** for the treating clinician (including pre-populating the patient’s profile and attaching supporting information to Context)
- **Generate documents** for the treating clinician to review after the session (like a referral letter or discharge summary)
- **Finalise administrative work** by sending and exporting documents
- **Handle requests for information** from patients or authorized health providers

![Heidi health AI screenshot](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67de0bf87616b100df31d30a_Assistant%20view.png)

For safety, the Assistant role has limited powers. Assistants **cannot**:

- **Start recording** \- They can prepare everything up to the point of ambiently listening to the patient encounter
- **Edit the first note after the patient encounter -** Assistants can create duplicates in new tabs, but cannot edit the treating clinician’s first note
- **Affect documents created by the treating clinician** \- However, Assistants have unlimited ability to create downstream documentation

**To add an Assistant to Heidi**, invite the staff member to join your team and assign them the Assistant role.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67e5db677c85338c6b939a37_Teams%20-%20roles.png)

Lastly, this is a **non-billable role**. We heard clinicians wanted their nurses, mid-level providers, and administrative assistants to share in the care of a patient, without increasing the team bill.

**Please note -** The Assistant role is in a phased roll-out, and will appear in all teams shortly. Please [contact support](https://www.heidihealth.com/contact) to request expedited access.

## Query Context with Ask Heidi

Gathering and organizing patient history is incredibly time-consuming, especially if you routinely get lengthy referrals for complex patients seen by multiple providers.

Fortunately, now that Ask Heidi can be used with [files attached to Context](https://www.heidihealth.com/changelog/context-upgrades-and-snomed-coding), manually wading through background documents to prepare for a session is a thing of the past.

![Heidi health AI screenshot](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67dd0de82651242a853b2970_Ask%20Heidi%20-%20with%20files.png)

To retrieve and collate information from patient history, simply attach files to Context (either a Clinician or Assistant can perform this task) and Ask Heidi for the information you want, with any instructions on how you would like it organized.

Here are some example queries:

- “List the dates the patient was admitted to hospital over the past 12 months”
- “Summarize the referral letter and all supporting documents from Dr. Smith”
- “Tell me the recommendations from the neurology review in September”
- “Give me the patient’s most recent medication list from their community pharmacy”
- “Make a list of findings from the last 3 radiology reports, organized by date”

The requested information appears in seconds just above the Ask Heidi box, with a range of utilization options.

## Stop note or document generation

Clinicians have been losing valuable seconds waiting for a note or document to generate that was started in error. So, in our pursuit of helping you achieve productivity singularity, we’ve added a button to stop generation.

![Heidi health AI screenshot](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67dd0e1b082d8a24bd78e46c_Loading.png)

Now, if you notice you’ve selected the wrong template or generated a document in the incorrect session, there’s no need to wait for Heidi to finish before moving on to your next task. Just hit stop and Heidi instantly aborts the action.

[**Improved text editor**](https://www.heidihealth.com/changelog/improved-text-editor)

[this link is used for the script](https://www.heidihealth.com/changelog/improved-text-editor)

![Copied Image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/651be5e5347ad738119bc256/6687b7aa334ea63f23b909e6_Tooltip%20(1).svg)

Users on Heidi are making increasingly sophisticated templates. We think this needs an equally sophisticated text editor.

We’ve migrated from rich text format to a HTML “block” editor. This change opens up a new world of possibilities for viewing, editing, interacting with, and exporting your notes and documents.

With sectional note editing, clinicians can now do things like:

- Drag a medication or diagnosis list to a different section of the note
- Transform a section of the note into a bulleted list
- Order a list with numbered and/or tiered indents (such as primary and secondary diagnoses)

All new capability via the block-based editor is designed to achieve note perfection directly within Heidi, avoiding the need to double-handle clinical documentation as it’s filed in the medical record.

## Drag, copy, and delete blocks of text

As your cursor hovers over a note or document, discrete blocks of text now auto-highlight in light blue, revealing enhanced editing and formatting options.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67ca73738702b909d76505d4_Text%20editor%20-%20Block.png)

To **move a line of text** to a different place in the note, **click and drag** the grab handle (2x3 grid of dots).

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67ca73b1c493e82886f25217_Text%20editor%20-%20click%20and%20drag.png)

Clicking the grab handle presents options for **copying or deleting a single line** within a note.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67ca73c560cbbdba40996021_Text%20editor%20-%20click%20action.png)

To **copy an entire block** of text, click the copy icon to the right and then paste where you desire.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67ca73d8dbada9cbbd598fb3_Text%20editor%20-%20copy%20block.png)

### Numbered and ordered lists

The block-based editor significantly expands options for creating numbered and ordered lists.

To **turn a block of text into a list**, simply highlight it with your mouse and choose the list type (Bullet list or Ordered list). Alternatively, the editor will automatically turn asterisks (\*) and number lists (“1.”) as bulleted and ordered lists respectively.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67ca73e8241879602d0cd66c_Text%20editor%20-%20numbered%20list.png)

You may now indent lists for more readable notes.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67ca73f664b8057623ae24e8_Text%20editor%20-%20indent%20list.png)

### Where we’re heading

While these appear to be useful quality-of-life improvements, this was a deceptively significant change that allows us to do more interesting things.

We’re working on allowing images, different header styles, and tables in-situ in the text editor, but also in your templates. Apart from enabling a smoother writing experience, this unlocks letterheads, signatures, descriptive images for patient explainers, imaging, and more.

Secondly, this allows us to finally pursue native form-building (as an entire separate category to notes / forms) in Heidi.

Lastly, it allows us to finally introduce point-of-cursor dictation, streamed live in your text. We expect to release this in the coming months.

## Pause button

We understand clinicians with large patient lists (often in inpatient environments) do not always have the luxury of taking a patient interaction to completion.

We’ve visually refreshed our session header (bon appetit, by the way), and included a pause button. This makes it easy to stop an interaction, then pick up exactly where you left off when ready.

This feature is particularly useful if you:

- Are prone to getting untimely phone calls
- Are frequently disrupted by colleagues in a collaborative environment
- Want to take a moment to review what you’ve done
- Need to pause the session while the patient has a test or investigation

The Pause button is located in the top right, next to the Stop button. It only appears when a listening event begins.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67ca740ebd857a68d67eeb24_New%20header%20-%20pause.png)

After pausing a session, you have the option of viewing what’s been transcribed or dictated so far. You can also make [additions to Context](https://www.heidihealth.com/au/changelog/context-upgrades-and-snomed-coding) (such as uploading results from a test).

To continue the session, just return to the top right and press Resume.

### Better volume visualizer

It is not always easy to know that your microphone is working correctly before and during your conversations. It is extremely frustrating to be met with an after-the-fact error for this reason.

So we’ve created a better, more sensitive volume visualizer in your new session header.

The new animation responds more sensitively to audio signals, ensuring you are always aware of the audio health of the session.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67ca74728702b909d765bf25_New%20header%20-%20Mic.png)

Green bars indicate that audio is successfully being processed, while red signals a problem, such as low volume or microphone issues.

## Attach files to Context

Great clinicians take into account more than the information that emerges _during_ a patient encounter. Yet, until now, Heidi’s _Context_ was suited mainly for point-of-care remarks and observations.

Heidi now supports uploading **PDFs, .doc files, and images** into Context, for more complete notes or documents.

Here are some things you may upload:

- Discharge summaries (to document transitions of care)
- Specialist reports (to include key recommendations)
- Patient intake forms (to capture pre-visit concerns and updates)
- Imaging reports with findings (to accurately document diagnostic results)
- Lab results (to analyze trends and incorporate results)
- Outside pharmacy records (to verify medication history)

Your imagination is the limit. If it’s information you’d need to write a great note, Heidi can make use of it, too.

To view supporting information about your uploaded files, select _View all_ above the paperclip icon.

Help Heidi understand your attachments by labelling each item with a date and a free-text description. However, Heidi will attempt to appropriately contextualize your attachments without this information.

In addition to attachments, continue using _Context_ as normal before and during the patient encounter. Heidi will consider all _Context_ in producing your text artefact.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67bc559902b88af8f9e5ddc1_Context%20-%20create%20note.png)

## Create documents from only Context

We’ve heard clinicians wanting to write medicolegal reports, compiling multiple past encounters, or otherwise creating documents outside the patient encounter.

Now, you can bypass transcribing to produce a document from _Context_:

1. Click New session
2. Navigate to the _Context_ tab
3. Type, paste, or upload encounter context
4. Select _Create note from context_ at the bottom right of your text editor
5. Select a template
6. Magic ensues

No longer is there a need to start and stop transcribing to produce text artefacts.

## SNOMED coding (alpha)

We want to eradicate clinician pyjama time. In the pursuit of getting you home on time, we noticed clinicians all across the world using Heidi to produce codes: ICD-10, CPT, HEDIS, HCC, SNOMED, MBS, and [more](https://getheidi.canny.io/features/p/coding-and-billing). Additionally, teams are bringing medical coders themselves onto Heidi.

So we built a purpose-built model for coding and baked it right into Heidi.

We’re convinced something has gone horribly wrong if clinicians are committing disease classification codes to memory.

This limited alpha is being previewed to a limited number of clinicians in the United Kingdom, for **SNOMED codes** only.

Users with access to this feature will now see suggested codes after processing a clinical encounter in Heidi.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67bc55b0a57023df054cc529_SNOMED%20codes%20-%20view%20code.png)

Clicking on the red code count opens the **_Review codes_** sidebar.

Each code in the sidebar appears as an interactive card, from which you can:

- **Confirm** the individual code by checking the box
- View **Code specification** by selecting the info icon

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67bc55c51e15bf99c94fa2b4_SNOMED%20codes%20-%20code%20specification.png)

- **Review evidence** from the transcript supporting the code (equalizer icon)

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67bc55d59cc7341614cd244d_SNOMED%20codes%20-%20view%20evidence.png)

- **Replace** the code by searching for a suitable alternative

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67bc55e8a49e2d8d12dddd82_SNOMED%20codes%20-%20replace.png)

- **Remove** the code from the list

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67bc55fad4a65c5e5b2d17b2_SNOMED%20codes%20-%20remove.png)

You can also add new codes from the sidebar and confirm all codes in the list.

**Confirmed codes** are appended to the bottom of your note. You can click individual codes to make further changes if required.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67bc560a0c49ad30e56f32d6_SNOMED%20codes%20-%20confirm%20code.png)

**Please note:** Clinicians are responsible for manually reviewing all suggested codes to ensure they accurately reflect the patient encounter.

**Also note**: We have plenty more codesets on the way. If you’re interested, please submit requests or vote [here](https://getheidi.canny.io/features?selectedCategory=coding). If you are a UK clinician and want to enrol to this alpha, reach out to us.

Teams on Heidi are growing in complexity. Private surgical practices are bringing on their PAs. Specialist groups are inviting their administrative staff. Primary care clinics are involving their reception staff.

So we’re embarking on a body of work around making life as a team easier, beginning with an improved team experience.

Administrators can assign roles direct from the Team page (accessed via the sidebar). This is an interface update in preparation for 5 new Teams roles rolling out later this month.

![Heidi Health AI app screenshot - Team view](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67aa85c32e7911a4490ab67f_Team%20-%20management.png)

One or both of the following roles may be assigned:

- **Administrator -** Can change team settings, assign roles, and manage team templates. Together / Enterprise team administrators can view team members’ sessions and generate documents (but not edit transcripts).
- **Clinician -** Provides full access for healthcare providers to create and manage clinical documentation with Heidi. Clinicians _can not_ modify team templates or team settings.


![Heidi Health AI app screenshot - Update roles](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67aa85e5a31d9495487466df_Team%20-%20update%20role.png)

### Global team settings

For Administrators of teams on the Together and Enterprise tier, the **Team settings** menu (accessed via the top right cog icon) has expanded options for adjusting global team settings:

- **Enable session view switcher -** Allow your team members to access the sessions of other members. This setting may be applied to Clinicians, Administrators, or both.
- **Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) -** Toggle whether MFA is required for team members to sign into their Heidi account.
- **Require patient consent -** When enabled, all team members see a pop-up reminder to ask for consent before starting a session.
- **Automatically delete past sessions -** Schedule your team’s sessions to delete on a recurring basis (between 1 to 90 days).

![Heidi Health AI app screenshot - Team settings](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/67aa85f0a6320a02edaf222e_Team%20-%20global%20settings.png)

Read the Help Center article for more information on [Role Based Access Controls](https://www.heidihealth.com/support/en/articles/10382257-role-based-access-controls).

## Optimized default specialty note templates

Heidi automatically adds a specialty-appropriate template to your template library when you create an account.

Many clinicians happily use this default specialty template for a majority of notes. However, given the sheer variety of clinicians adopting Heidi, we decided to tweak the default templates to make them more purpose-fit for their respective specialties.

So far, we’ve updated 11 default specialty note templates:

- Cardiology
- Psychiatry
- Physiotherapy
- Pediatrics
- Dietetics
- Dentistry
- Paramedicine
- Emergency Medicine
- Neurology
- General Surgery
- Anaesthesiology

Currently, the notification panel will serve reminders that sessions are going to be deleted shortly, provided you’ve set an automatically scheduled deletion in your **Preferences**.

Clicking the ellipses (...) reveals notifications options.

You can manage notification settings in **Preferences**.

‍ [Let us know](https://getheidi.canny.io/features?category=notifications) of any additional notifications you’d like to see.

## Grouping sessions by date

We recently made it easier to keep your sessions list organized with the [Tidy up button](https://www.heidihealth.com/changelog/link-split-start-tidy-sessions) (deletes all empty sessions). However, we’ve heard navigating long lists of past sessions can still be challenging.

To make it easier to find sessions you want to continue working on, we’ve added auto-populating date headings throughout your Past Sessions list.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/679323c4d6aa56abf6cf90f3_6793237f5e4b4fe51be11768_Memory%2520-%2520custom%2520date.png)

‍

If you haven’t already, set your preferred [date formatting in Memory](https://www.heidihealth.com/changelog/memory) so session headings follow the structure you’re most familiar with.

## Display settings

We added two options to the **Preferences** menu worth paying attention to.

1. **Show consent pop-up -** add or remove the patient consent reminder at the beginning of each session (including a link to [Learn more about patient consent](https://intercom.help/heidi-health/en/articles/8973150-obtaining-patient-consent)).
2. ‍ **Hide my email address in sidebar -** removes the risk of a patient seeing your email address if they view your device during an in-person visit.

## Heidi desktop app (optimized for telehealth)

The Heidi desktop app has been in beta for the past few months and thanks to all of your feedback, it’s now ready for general release!

Purpose-built for telehealth sessions, advantages of the desktop app include:

- **Headphones support:** Compatible with both Bluetooth and wired headsets, enabling smooth recording with your preferred headset.
- **Reduced interruptions:** System-level audio capture means other applications won’t interfere with your sessions.
- **Superior stability:** The Desktop app is the most stable way for clinicians who rely heavily on telehealth to utilize Heidi.

Any sessions you undertake on the desktop app sync seamlessly with other versions of Heidi, such as the mobile app and Chrome extension (both still in beta), and of course, the original browser version of Heidi.

[Download Heidi on your desktop](https://www.heidihealth.com/download) today.

Instructions, setup, and troubleshooting for the desktop app is [available in the help centre](https://www.heidihealth.com/support/en/articles/10060391-desktop-application)

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/6784b4c02034298542d884ab_6784b4880aa06c68772129c7_Microphone.png)

## Patient and clinician name preferences

As clinicians ourselves, we understand just how often you refer to patients throughout an average day's documentation.

We all have our own preferences around this. Some use the term “patient,” others like “Mrs. Smith,” and some of us simply use the patient's first name. You also likely refer to yourself in most notes, with statements like, “Dr. John to submit a referral for an MRI.”

To make Heidi’s notes sound just like you, we added options to specify exactly how you want to refer to patients and yourself. To set patient and clinician name preferences:

1. Access **Memory** via the sidebar

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/6784b4c02034298542d884b1_6784b49bc5d913fb35f3ecd2_Selecting%2520memory.png)

2. Enter your preferred terms under **Language & spelling**

**Note:** You can choose a single term, such as “client” or “patient.” Or give Heidi instructions like “Title + Lastname” and we will infer the correct terminology via session information.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/6784b4c02034298542d884b4_6784b4aa1baadfbe8353e2d5_Language%2520%2526%2520spelling.png)

3. Click **Save changes**(top right)

Heidi will now use your preferred patient and clinician name preferences throughout all notes and documents.

## Patient profiles and session linking

As more clinicians make Heidi the centerpiece of their daily workflows, we’re hearing that you want an easy way to manage patient information across multiple sessions.

With patient profiles and session linking, you can now create, update, and organize a patient’s information under a single customizable patient identifier. You might think of this as a patient “file” within Heidi.

Patient profiles and linked sessions make it easy to group, access, and edit previous sessions. It also streamlines the process of asking Heidi to utilize historical patient data in notes for follow-up sessions or document generation.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Create a patient profile** by navigating to a session, clicking the session name box, and choosing a patient identifier

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/677dd309de0a7bb66a638b02_677dd1690798ea27fd19baab_Create%2520patient%2520profile.png)

2. **Use the link button** to link sessions from your list to the patient profile (new sessions can also be directly added to a patient profile)

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/677dd309de0a7bb66a638af9_677dd1a88ffe7d59983bff07_Link%2520patient.png)

3. Click a date within a patient’s profile to **view and open previous sessions**

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/677dd308de0a7bb66a638ae6_677dd17f145a32714b571ab3_Link%2520patient%2520-%2520all%2520sessions.png)

**Adding past visits to a current session**

When conducting follow-up sessions or writing a report/treatment summary, you may find it helpful to bring in context from a patient’s previous visits. Linked sessions make this process much easier, as previous sessions can be stored under a patient’s profile.

To add context from previous visits:

1. Start a new session
2. Locate and copy previous notes
3. Paste copied notes into the Context tab
4. Start transcription

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/677dd308de0a7bb66a638ae9_677dd1966776d67bb59e45d8_Link%2520patient%2520-%2520paste%2520past%2520context.png)

As you proceed, Heidi incorporates the contextual notes you added, distinguishing between past and present content.

**_Please note:_** _We’re working on features to generate a pre-chart summary and automatically incorporate past session details into notes or documents._

Read our Help Centre article for a full overview of [patient profiles and session linking](https://intercom.help/heidi-health/en/articles/10122397-patient-profiles-and-session-linking-in-heidi), along with tips for maximizing contextual notes with Heidi’s templates.

## Split screen

You can now split your screen within Heidi to view and work with tabs side-by-side. For example, you might like Context open on the left and Transcript on the right. Or, you could have a session Note open next to a Referral letter.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/677dd309de0a7bb66a638afc_677dd29906becfde35d0c8e4_Split%2520view.png)

To configure the split screen for any of your tabs, simply right-click on a tab you want open and select the left or right option. Click and drag the center separating line between tabs to adjust the size of each window.

## Start sessions faster

We’ve done away with the old start screen and replaced it with…nothing.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/677dd38feeb47b63865c3962_677dd1c56c8038d85b5b364c_Session.png)

All the options from the previous start screen are available via the top menu bar in the Sessions screen (like Voice, Brain hemisphere, and Language. So now, to start a session, change any settings if needed, then hit Start Transcribing.

## Quickly delete empty sessions

There are lots of reasons you might end up with empty sessions stored in your list. Rather than deleting them individually, you can now simply press the Tidy up button at the bottom of your sessions list and Heidi will automatically delete any empty sessions.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/677dd309de0a7bb66a638b44_677dd20cb0b2b7b98bc5ca6b_Delete%2520empty%2520sessions.png)

Sessions are only considered empty if they contain no information whatsoever. So you can rest assured that you won’t lose any important patient info when using this feature.

## Updated mobile app (+ offline mode) in beta

Heidi’s mobile app has been in open beta for a couple of months now, specifically designed to make your Heidi experience smoother, portable, and more reliable than ever.

We’ve heard that many of you struggle with patchy internet conditions. Therefore, the standout feature of this release is offline mode.

Now, you can start and stop your sessions even without internet connectivity. Everything will be safely saved, and your notes will sync as soon as you’re back online.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/677db0b9e30e439e9ec8e54a_677db09c6ec943371422e0f8_offline%2520mode.png)

## Single-session multilingual support

After feedback from our bilingual users, we’ve added a Multilingual (Beta) option to Language settings.

With Multilingual set as the input language, clinicians and patients are free to switch between any of the 58 supported languages during a session and Heidi will seamlessly process everything that’s said.

You can then choose the most appropriate output language, depending on whether your note or document is going on the EHR, to another clinician, or to the patient or a family member.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/677dae305b979f073c11c47c_677dae19e30e439e9ec695a8_Multilingual%2520support.png)

## Snippets (macros, Heidi style)

Snippets lets you create shortcuts for frequently used blocks of text, so you can edit outputs faster and more efficiently.

**To set up a Snippet:**

- Go to Memory
- Click New snippet
- Name your snippet and insert the content you want it to generate
- Click Create Snippet

_You can also highlight a block of text in any output and save it as a Snippet._

With a Snippet created, simply type our magic character “/” followed by your snippet name and hit enter. The shortcut will instantly expand into your saved text block!

You can add as many Snippets as you like in Memory.

Memory is a new set of preferences that define how you would like your note to appear stylistically. This is part of a suite of work we’re embarking on to make your Heidi sound more like you.

These sit separately to your templates, and are operative en masse on all of your sessions, remembering how you like dates formatted, permanent spelling corrections, and more. A kind of memory, if you will…

On launch, there are 3 options in your Memory:

1. **Date -** Select your preferred format for listing dates (eg., YYYY/MM/DD or MM/DD/YYYY)
2. **Language & spelling -** Set input and output language and make UK or US English the default spelling choice
3. **Replace -** Customize your word library with commonly misspelled words, preferred abbreviations, and word substitutions, and Heidi will automatically use these in your outputs

#### Bulk text edits (find and replace)

If you notice a misspelled word during your session, or an abbreviation or word substitution you would like to make, just highlight the relevant text with your mouse and click ‘Find & replace.’

In the menu that appears you can specify the replacement. Then, tell Heidi whether you would like to apply the change to all instances within your current output, across all outputs in your session, or for all future occurrences (by adding it to your word library in Memory settings).

Please see the Help Centre article on [Memory](https://www.heidihealth.com/support/en/articles/9913729-memory) for a full overview of personalized memory settings.

## Shortcuts

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/671031b64faa84026fa9f025_6710318b2a7ff97d6138dbbc_Keyboard%2520shortcuts.png)

Use new keyboard shortcuts to pursue productivity singularity by shaving milliseconds off your workflow.

See the full list by clicking Shortcuts in the bottom-left of the sidebar (or do it the right way and just press S to reveal the menu).

So far, we’ve created a total of 24 shortcuts for:

- Managing sessions
- General tasks (like copy, paste, undo)
- Navigating around Heidi
- Toggling settings
- Formatting in notes and documents

More coming soon, so keep an eye on the Shortcuts menu for new additions.

## Rich text editor (bold & italics)

We understand that sometimes it’s the small touches that make a perfect note. So we’ve made it easy to add rich text formatting, like bold and italics.

To add formatting, highlight the segment of text you want to change and you’ll see your formatting options hover above.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/671031b74faa84026fa9f03c_6710319c2468245f39b610a6_Rich%2520Text%2520Editor%2520(1).png)

Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcuts you’re likely already familiar with from your favorite text editors—ctrl+B for bold and ctrl+I for italics.

Wrap text in your templates with the notations \*\* and \_ to make permanent bolding and italicizing (respectively) in your notes.

Finally, we added new copy states so you can choose what formatting gets carried over when you copy your note. You may copy as plain text (required for some EHRs), copy with formatting (without lists), or copy with formatting (with lists).

## Instant feedback system

We’ve heard that on occasion (rarely, we hope), Heidi can be a little temperamental.

This happens because we’re always tinkering on the back end to achieve note perfection and a blissful clinical documentation experience.

However, outside of traditional support channels, there has never been a quick way for you to tell us when Heidi is going right—or when there is room for improvement.

Now, with our integrated feedback system, you can use a simple smiley face rating scale to tell us how satisfied you are with your note, letter, or document (bonus points if you also add a short text description).

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/671031b74faa84026fa9f037_671031adaa7d8efdda9c7390_Feedback%2520pop%2520up.png)

We’ll use this additional feedback data to make Heidi more accurate and efficient, so you can save even more time on writing notes.

Templates are blueprints that Heidi uses to define your preferred structure and style for notes and documents, so that they sound just like you.

So far, outside of [Teams](https://www.heidihealth.com/au/changelog/introducing-teams), template creation has been a solo activity. But now, with the release of the Template Community, you can **interact with fellow clinicians** from around the world to share, use, and improve field-tested Heidi templates.

#### Grab ‘n’ go templates

We’ve heard for a long time that it takes a little massaging and fine-tuning to get your templates to work exactly as you want them to. What if, instead, you could grab a working template from another user? A grab ‘n’ go, if you will.

Instead of creating a template from scratch, you can now access a public library of **specialty-appropriate templates** that have been created by other clinicians using Heidi.

We think it works for everybody:

1. If you’re a new Heidi user, skip the initial learning curve and pick up a template.
2. If you want to create your own template, but not from scratch, fine-tune a Community template.
3. If you’re an experienced Heidi user, tattoo your name on your most powerful templates and receive the quiet admiration of your colleagues (we see you Dr. David Canes).

You can use Community templates for as long as you like. You are also welcome to save and modify your own copy to suit your exact practice needs and preferences.

#### Share template love with the Community

If you’ve created a template you are particularly proud of, you may upload it to the Community. Love makes the world go ‘round.

**Template creators' names are listed** on uploaded templates, along with how many times each template has been used.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/66d813889701f622e3f8b26e_66d80fc61ef0066557048fec_Community%2520Template%2520by%2520Heidi.png)

#### Using Community templates

To browse Community templates, click **Community** in your sidebar.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/66e041600bcc3f00a3505fa6_66e04156d5276f511a1d1bb1_Template%2520community%2520-%2520side%2520bar%2520community.png)

In the Template Community, you can **search templates** based on:

- Title
- Creator
- Description

Results can then be **filtered and sorted** by:

- Specialty
- Region
- Category
- Popularity
- Recency

Once you find the custom template that works for you, click into the template, then press **Use template** to add it to your personal library. You can now edit the template (if desired) and add it to your Favorites.

Please see our Help Centre article on [Getting started with Community templates](https://www.heidihealth.com/support/en/articles/9747185-getting-started-with-community-templates) for more detailed instructions.

### New sidebar

The old sidebar has been on our kill list for a while. You’ll find it is now far easier to navigate to key pages, find past sessions, and access customer support.

We’ve also pulled upcoming sessions from your active EHR integrations into a unified, tabbed **Sessions** view.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/66d94729e7c708fd8db319d0_66d9472234130b9809972f7e_Template%2520community%2520-%2520side%2520bar.png)

## Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Individual users and organizations now have the option of [enabling multi-factor authentication](https://www.heidihealth.com/support/en/articles/10763751-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-in-heidi) (MFA) on Heidi.

MFA **enhances the security** of your Heidi account by requiring an additional verification step beyond your password (such as a verification code sent via email).

Last week, [we released Teams](https://www.heidihealth.com/changelog/introducing-teams). Today, we’ve improved how teams and groups collaborate. Multiple users can now generate documents from a single patient encounter.

We’ve heard it isn’t always feasible for one clinician to singlehandedly manage a patient’s documentation burden end-to-end.

You can now delegate post-encounter documentation by vesting in your Team Administrator the ability to **filter for another clinician’s session view**, then **create / edit / delete documents** from any selected session.

This is suitable for settings where several clinical and non-clinical staff may be required to document their interaction with a patient for the same episode of care.

As an **Administrator** with this feature enabled:

- Navigate to the ‘User’ filter in your sidebar (denoted by a stethoscope icon)
- Select a team member
- View the core note, shown in a disabled state
- Click ‘ **Create Document**’, and proceed as you normally would

Heidi will maintain multi-directional syncing across all instances. Admin A’s document edits to Clincian B’s sessions will reflect in every user with view privileges for that session.

Administrators with this capability are unable to edit / delete the original note / document produced from the encounter; only downstream derivative documents.

This is the start of a suite of collaboration features that will make Heidi more multiplayer for teams of all sizes, from local clinics, to large multi-disciplinary hospital systems.

**Note**: This feature is only available to teams on [the Clinic tier](https://www.heidihealth.com/pricing), and for a limited number of teams as part of a phased rollout.

### Brain

Brain is a new setting that allows users to choose the type of thinking that processes a patient encounter. This can improve the quality of document generation by aligning the output with clinician preferences.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/66a88a290d60e7f0c33f9310_66a889d324cfe3b378b8b42e_Team%2520collaboration%2520-%2520brain%2520hemisphere.png)

The default Brain hemisphere can be changed in ‘Settings’ or by pressing ‘Remember’ when the setting dropdown menu is open.

Each time a user toggles between Left and Right Brain, the note will regenerate.

### Cliniko integration

For [Clinic-level](https://www.heidihealth.com/pricing) subscribers, Heidi now integrates with Cliniko (practice management software for clinics and allied health professionals).

To connect Heidi and Cliniko accounts, users must login to Heidi, click ‘Integrations,’ choose Cliniko from the dropdown box, then follow the instructions.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/66c53768b8564b4ea7f55107_66c5375ea9b75ea20f0eb958_Team%2520collaboration%2520-%2520integrations.png)

With Heidi and Cliniko, connected users can:

- Access Cliniko patient demographic and appointment information within Heidi
- Send a note from Heidi to Cliniko (stored as a treatment note for that patient)

### Humane quota messaging

We heard you. It's really annoying to be confronted with a blocking screen when your patients are at your doorstep. So we've broken from standard software patterns to devise a suite of quota informers suited to time-poor clinicians.

Every time you consume a Pro action, we'll let you know in a neat, little toast message, so that there are no surprises. We've also improved our iconography across the platform for improved clarity.

If you, **as a free user**, exhaust your monthly quota for Pro actions, your are now given the option to delay the prompt to upgrade for up to 24 hours. You pick how long you need, and we'll honour that.

When the delay period expires, we'll guide you to unhooking a Pro template from your default settings, so that you're not left wondering why Heidi has permanently planted a paywall (we have not!).

Teams enables groups of clinicians or entire clinics to work more collaboratively within Heidi.

A team is managed by one administrator who provides a central point of coordination for:

- **Adding and removing** team members
- Organizing shared **billing**
- Managing shared **templates**

At present, Teams is only available to Pro and Clinic level subscribers.

### Simple, unified billing

Team billing centralizes all billing tasks under one administrative control. This means there is a single invoice for the entire team, regardless of the number of members.

Admins can invite members to join via email. Upon inviting a new user, they are prompted to sign up for an account, and incurred to the team as a Pro Member. When an existing user with a free plan is added, they will be upgraded to Pro.

The only change for a Pro user joining a team is that their billing will now be managed by the Admin.

A Team is billed on a regular monthly or annual cycle, as chosen by the Admin.

### Shared organizational templates

For Teams on the Clinic plan, templates can now be configured and managed at the organization-level. This helps to achieve consistency, compliance, and quality in documentation across a clinic or organization.

**Admins** can create, edit, and share templates with their team.

When an Admin shares a template (by changing its visibility settings), it is pinned to the ‘Favorites’ section of the ‘My Templates’ screen for all team members.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/66985fca038b8e403399a9a5_Team%20billing%20templates.png)

When an Admin edits a template, changes are synced to all instances of that template across the team.

**Team Members** can use shared templates, but can’t make permanent changes to the original.

If a Team Member renders an edit to a shared template, Heidi automatically creates a local duplicate to customize as desired. Members can also create their own templates without sharing them with others, just as before.

### Referral program improvements

We’ve made our Referral Program substantially simpler and easier to use.

When a referral link is used, the referrer will receive:

- $10 USD per sign-up\*
- $40 USD (additional to the $10) if a referee becomes a paid user of any tier

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652b12f8222a1e9f8bf494eb/66985fe455aff7f04a6645a5_Team%20billing%20referral.png)

Users who sign up with a referral link get a 30-day free trial on a paid subscription tier.

Referral Program payouts are made via PayPal, with currency converted from USD on withdrawal.

\\* _Referral sign-ups must have at least 10 sessions greater than 1 minute in the first 30 days. Heidi may conduct additional authenticity checks before distributing funds to rule out instances of fraudulent activities related to a user account._
